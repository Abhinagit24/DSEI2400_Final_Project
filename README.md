# Quest Query - An Advanced Web Scraping Tool

This is a data engineering project, where I worked with another student in developing a web browser that automates the processes of searching for urls for a given 
'search term' and outputs a table which holds a list of urls that are displayed in the order of their relevance related to the search term, gathered from multiple
web browsers. The browser is built on python using Selenium, a python package used for automation of web browser interactions.
